<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

There are many great and briliant projects on all the Web3; however with Hype and FOMO, Bad people and scammers use these new concepts and technologies to take advantage of people by copying sites or simply creating projects that do not add value to the community. With that in mind, we created a tool for the community to interact and decide on the reliability or trustability of a project in a decentralized and humanized way.

Here's why:
<br>
*Trust is a psychological state characterized by the intention to accept vulnerability, based on optimistic beliefs about the intentions (or 
behavior) of the other.
<br>
*Consensus is a concept that describes a type of agreement produced by consent between all members of a group or between several groups.
<br>
*Everyone has the right to enjoy the best on the Web3 whitout being tricked :smile:

Of course, achieving a high level of trust and doing it in a decentralized way demands a high effort and needs the interaction of several users. Therefore, we will explain below how we propose to achieve this objective and which tools we use!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To start using the Neverest solution you have to install the extension and connect with your wallet on polygon network.
<br>

After connected you'll be able to rate if the web3site is trustable or untrustable, and write some comment about what you think about.

## How it works

The idea is to build an extension for chromium-based browsers that allows the user to connect their wallet, inform if the site is trustworthy or not and leave a comment about it. The extension allows the visualization of previous reviews to help in the formation of the user's opinion.
<br/>
The smart contract is deployed to the polygon network and has state variables and mappings that store the voter address and the comment about the site and functions to execute the review logic and avoid bulk reviews by a single user. 
<br/>
As an additional form of security and to ensure that users are not bots calling functions infinitely, the Proof of Humanity by Human Protocol is used. We used the modules Proof-of-Humanity-React, Proof-of-Humanity hCaptcha Validator API, poh-validator-hcaptcha-react and poh-contracts.
